# AC to DC Voltage Regulator PCB Design

This project presents the design of an AC to DC regulated power supply PCB using KiCad. The circuit uses a full-wave bridge rectifier, filtering capacitors, and a voltage regulator to provide a stable DC output suitable for embedded systems and low-power electronics. It serves as a practical and learning-oriented reference for understanding power supply design and PCB layout in KiCad.

## Features
- Full-wave bridge rectifier using 1N4007 diodes
- Smoothing capacitor for ripple reduction
- Power ON LED indicator
- Linear voltage regulator (AMS1117)
- Stable DC output suitable for microcontrollers
- Designed using KiCad with beginner-friendly schematic and PCB layout  

## Power Flow
AC Input → Bridge Rectifier → Filter Capacitor → Voltage Regulator → DC Output

## Applications
- Embedded systems
